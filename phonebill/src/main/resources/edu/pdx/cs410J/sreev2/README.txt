Project 1: phonebill

This phonebill project displays information about a phone call using the information entered by the customer while running this program.

The information consists of customer Name, Caller Number, Callee Number, Start Date, Start Time, End Date, End Time.

Along with this information, the users get two switches options, -README switch and -print switch (these switches can be given in any order, before the arguments).

The program takes in this information and performs appropriate functionality based on the switch selected and information given.

When -README switch is selected, irrespective of any argument or switch given or not, the program displays the README.txt file describing the functionality of the program and does not perform any other operations.

When -print switch is given, the program checks if the required number of arguments (information that user enters, as mentioned above) are given by the user or not.

If given, it validates the given arguments for a correct format, then it prints the information about the phone call of the user.

If the arguments are not given or the validation fails, the program informs the details of error to the user. The program also raises error when, too many arguments are provided by the user.

When neither of the two options are given but the user provides all the required arguments in correct format the program does not display anything.
